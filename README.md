# BrickBuilder

My objective for ClojureCup is to prepare a prototype of a simple programming environment using visual representations of motors, sensors and (very) basic flow control constructs with support for driving the USB devices for the [Lego WeDo set](http://education.lego.com/en-us/lego-education-product-database/wedo/9580-lego-education-wedo-construction-set). I'm going to create it as a Chrome app, utilizing the capability to communicate with USB devices using Chrome SDK. I will want to utilize Om for creating the UI part.

This will be a simple project to scratch my own itch. Recently, I have made a present for my son's birthday in a form of [Lego WeDo construction set](http://education.lego.com/en-us/lego-education-product-database/wedo/9580-lego-education-wedo-construction-set). That's a set of Lego bricks, a small electric motor along with motion and tilt sensors - all this can be tethered to a computer through a provided Lego USB hub. It's targeted at younger audience than that of well known NXT/Mindstorms.

The thing is, I didn't buy the dedicated application for programming those bricks which is sold separately and costs almost as much as bricks themselves (where I live at least).

It's main advantage over Scratch - which supports WeDo seamlessly by the way - is that the interface is explicitly targeted at younger children, who didn't yet learn to read - which is the case with my 5yr old son. My other pet peeve with the official app (besides the price) is also the fact that it's Windows only.

Due to limited time (I will have only a couple of hours available for the challenge), I will rather focus on core features and will be happy if those get accomplished within the given timeframe.
